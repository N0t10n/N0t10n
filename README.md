From the vast universe to the tiniest matter is where my intrigued gaze reside.

My Github profile is a reflection of doubts and challenges aimed to grow and answer things I observe. Therefore you'll find diversity of content, mostly related to Data Science, specially in Machine Learning.

Stay tuned for upcoming projects and feel free to reach me, I'd love to hear from your inquietude. Knowledge must be shared and spread!
